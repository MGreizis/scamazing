import Scene from './Scene.js';

/**
 * Represents a basic Game Loop based on `requestAnimationFrame()`.
 *
 * The implementation of this class depends on another class: `Scene`. This
 * means that, if you use this class, you must have a class that is a subclass
 * of `Scene` that overides the three methods `processInput()`, `update(elapsed)`
 * and `render()`.
 *
 * It is possible for a game to switch to another Scene object during the game, so
 * you can create different classes for each game screen, levels, etc. To let the
 * gameloop switch to another scene, you must return an instance of a new Scene
 * subclass in the `update(elapsed)` method. See the documentation of that method
 * in the `Scene` class for more information on this.
